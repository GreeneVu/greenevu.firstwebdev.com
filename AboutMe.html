      I was grown up by my beloved mom, who is a pharmacist, so she always cares so much about everyone's health. During my childhood until now, I have also unforternately suffered from a lot of disease that other siblings of mine never have. Therefore, I have learned how to take care of myself since I was a toddler (kidding ;)) <br><br>
      I always love cooking and hearing how different people take care themselves with food. Culinary is a magical things which pull people together. To me, it is a non-verbal communication as well.<br><br>
      To me, well being is not only about keeping your physical health the best, but also about your mental, emotional and spiritual condition. <br><br>
      To all the creatures in this universe, you surely cannot drink from an empty cup. I hope you take good care of your amazing body and soul.

        My most favorite book of all the time is "The story of a Seagull and the Cat who taught her fly". The book tells the story just as you can read (hehe). <br><br>
        "It is very easy to accept and love those who are like us, but to love someone different is very hard, and you helped us to do that."(Luis Sep√∫lveda,1996). The Cat(s) had raised the baby Seagull since she was just an egg until she wanted to fly without thinking of traning her to become a cat. <br><br>
        Just a small book, not so long, but there are tons of lessons that I have learned from it. <br><br>
        Loving and empathizing to those who are not the same to us is what I always want to practice in my life, especially animals and natures which we have always thought different from us.<br><br>

              Here in Greenery, we together share about all the things that makes our lives a little bit more smiley without judgement. We all have the different experience in our lives, which together forms each individual's personality, behaviour and belief. <br><br>
              Therefore, I hope you somehow find a place to read and share things with the community. It is okay to feel not agreed, we are all
