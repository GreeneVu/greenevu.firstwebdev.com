This project I created to make use of HTML and CSS skills. This is my first personal site.

Website Greenery

My website includes 5 main parts: Home, About Me, Recipes, Blog And Contact.

In Recipes and Blog parts, I have two other extended blogs.

Other than that, I set the links to Facebook page, Instagram page and YouTube channel on every single page of the website. The assessor can access the link through the bar on the top of each page.

The logo on each page also links to the Home page.
